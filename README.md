Special thanks to all coders that are really helpful for my very first Swift project,

Introduction

    This app includes many functions, including humberger button, and pull to refresh, etc.
    
    1. Introduction Page
    When lauched the first time, the introduction pages will show up. 
    Once lauched, the intro pages will never show again.
